# config/blinkr.yml
# YAML Template
# The blinkr.yml file is preprocessed by ERb; this allows you to use ruby code to generate values in your blinkr.yml files.
# So if you have several config files with similar values you could do something like:
# <% sitemap_loc = "#{File.dirname(File.expand_path('.', __FILE__))}/critical-links-sitemap.xml" %>
# custom_sitemap: <%= sitemap_loc %>

# BEGIN
#
# The URL to check (often specified on the command line)
#
base_url: https://www.example.com

#
# Links and pages not to check (may be a regexp or a string).
# skips:
#  - !ruby/regexp /^https:\/\/developers\.redhat\.com\/quickstarts\.*\/.*/
#  - https://developers.redhat.com/dont/test/me
#
skips:

#
# Errors to ignore when generating the output. Each ignore should be a hash
# containing a url (may be regexp or a string), an error code (integer) and a
# error message (may be a regexp or a string)

   # - url: !ruby/regexp /^https?:\/\/(www\.)?acme\.com\/bar\/
